This is a playground for ideas relating to user interface and
application development on the various OSes I use.

The long term goal is to replace a large subset of the main
POSIX-style userland with something simpler, and easier for a
single user to manage.

Don't expect it to be complete, and don't expect a typical
clone of the various *nix tools. I'm more than willing to try
different things and hopefully will find something interesting.
