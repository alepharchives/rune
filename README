Rune
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is my attempt to develop a completely free userland for
the various OSes I use.

Don't expect it to be complete, and don't expect a typical
clone of the various *nix tools. I'm more than willing to try
different things and hopefully will find something interesting.

---------------------------------------------------------------
At present there is a mix of languages; I'm hoping to eventually
move most of this into Retro with an extended VM that allows me
to access the underlying OS functionality I need.

Once this is done, porting Rune to new platforms will mostly be
a matter of recompiling the underlying VM.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Todo:

  - Add data store (sqlite database)
  - Add I/O ports to access data store
  - Add network I/O device (see Jens notes on Retro mail list)
  - Extend VM to handle multiple tasks at the Forth level
  - Add VM support for curses-like screen model
  - Start coding up a UI
